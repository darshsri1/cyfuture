🌟 CyFuture - AI Image Generator
CyFuture is a Streamlit-based web application that generates images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. It leverages the diffusers library from Hugging Face to create AI-generated images in real-time. The app is designed to run on both CPU and GPU, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

🚀 Features
✅ Text-to-Image Generation: Convert text prompts into stunning AI-generated images.
✅ Guidance Scale Control: Adjust how closely the generated image follows the prompt.
✅ Download Images: Save your creations in PNG format.
✅ Lightweight & Fast: Optimized for CPU usage, with GPU acceleration support for faster performance.
